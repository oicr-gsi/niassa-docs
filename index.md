The open source Niassa project is a portable software
infrastructure designed to analyze massive genomics datasets produced by
contemporary and emerging technologies, in particular Next Generation
Sequencing (NGS) platforms.  It consists of a comprehensive suite of
infrastructure tools focused on enabling the end-to-end analysis of sequence
data -- from from raw base calling to analyzed variants ready for
interpretation by users. 

The Documentation pages show how to install and use
Niassa.
