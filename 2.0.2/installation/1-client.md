If you are within an environment that already has Niassa configured and set up
(hi OICR!), you will only need to configure your environment to interact with 
the system. As long as you have access to the Niassa webservice host and the appropriate 
permissions, you can write new workflows, install those workflows on the remote 
Niassa system, schedule workflows remotely, etc.
