Niassa began its life as the SeqWare project. The [SeqWare](http://seqware.io) 
project was started in 2007 by Brian O'Connor at UCLA. 
In 2011 Brian moved to OICR in Toronto, where SeqWare was adopted by the 
analysis team for all production workflows and was the primary analysis system 
until 2018. SeqWare was also used extensively in the 
[PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes](http://docs.icgc.org/pcawg/) project.

Niassa was forked from SeqWare in 2017 by the 
[Genome Sequence Informatics](https://github.com/oicr-gsi) (GSI) team at 
[Ontario Institute for Cancer Research](https://oicr.on.ca) in order to more 
closely support some of its other infrastructure. Other open-source 
infrastructure that integrates with Niassa includes 
[Shesmu](https://github.com/oicr-gsi/shesmu), a decision-driven action launching 
system, and [Cerberus](https://github.com/oicr-gsi/cerberus), a web service that 
integrates data from laboratory information management systems like 
[MISO](https://github.com/TGAC/miso-lims) and analysis engines like Niassa. 

Niassa is used by GSI to run all production analysis workflows and supports the 
[OICR Genomics](https://genomics.oicr.on.ca) team, the [Translational Genomics Laboratory](https://labs.oicr.on.ca/translational-genomics-laboratory), 
[OICR's collaborative research resources](https://oicr.on.ca/collaborative-research-resources/) 
and the [Canadian Data Integration Centre](http://genome-cdic.ca/).

Much of Niassa's underlying code remains the same as SeqWare and so we 
gratefully thank [SeqWare contributors](http://seqware.github.io/partners/) for 
their efforts.
